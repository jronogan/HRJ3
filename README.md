## 🔧 Backend API Integration

**Authentication Endpoints:**

- `POST /users/register` - User registration with multi-step validation
- `POST /users/login` - User login with JWT token generation
- `GET /users/me` - Retrieve authenticated user profile data
- `PATCH /users/{id}` - Update user profile information

**Nutrition Endpoints:**

- `GET /nutritionlogs/users/{userId}` - Retrieve all nutrition logs for a user
- `POST /nutritionlogs` - Create a new nutrition log
- `PUT /nutritionlogs/{id}` - Update an existing nutrition log
- `DELETE /nutritionlogs/{id}` - Delete a nutrition log
- `GET /nutritiongoals/{id}` - Retrieve nutrition goal settings
- `PUT /nutritiongoals/{id}` - Update nutrition goal settings
- CalorieNinjas API @ https://calorieninjas.com/api - Extract detailed nutrition information using text search

**Workout Endpoints:**

- `GET /workoutlogs/user/{userId}` - Retrieve all workout logs for a user
- `POST /workoutlogs` - Create a new workout log
- `PUT /workoutlogs/{id}` - Update an existing workout log
- `DELETE /workoutlogs/{id}` - Delete a workout log
- `GET /workoutgoals/{id}` - Retrieve workout goal settings
- `PUT /workoutgoals/{id}` - Update workout goal settings

**Data Validation:**

- All endpoints include comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Request/response data includes proper error messages and status codes
- Middleware enforces authentication on protected routes

## 🔑 Secure Configuration with .env Variables

To run this application locally, you must create a `.env` file in both the backend and frontend directories with the appropriate credentials. These environment variables are excluded from version control to protect the integrity of your backend services and sensitive credentials.

**Backend (.env):**

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_jwt_secret_access_key
SECRET_REFRESH_KEY=your_jwt_secret_refresh_key
PORT=5000
```

**Frontend (.env):**

```
VITE_SERVER=http://localhost:5000
VITE_NUTRITION_API_KEY=your_calorieningas_api_key
```

## 💡 Project Objectives & Takeaways

- **Full-Stack Development**: Gained practical experience building a complete MERN stack application with frontend-backend integration
- **React Architecture**: Mastered React component composition, Context API for state management, hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo), and conditional rendering patterns
- **Backend Development**: Developed REST API endpoints with Express.js, implemented proper authentication/authorization, and designed MongoDB schemas with Mongoose
- **Data Visualization**: Integrated Recharts to create interactive charts for nutrition and workout progress tracking
- **Form Handling & Validation**: Implemented multi-step registration forms with client-side and server-side validation
- **Responsive Design**: Built mobile-friendly UI using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries
- **API Integration**: Established secure communication between frontend and backend using JWT tokens and environment variables

## ⚔️ Project Challenges

- **Multi-Step Form Management**: Navigating state across multiple registration steps while maintaining data integrity and user experience
- **Real-Time Data Synchronization**: Ensuring accurate updates across the dashboard when users create/edit nutrition and workout logs
- **Complex Data Aggregation**: Calculating nutrition macros and workout statistics across multiple log entries for accurate progress visualization
- **User Authentication Flow**: Implementing secure JWT-based authentication with proper token management and error handling
